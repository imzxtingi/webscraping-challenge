Module 11 - Scrape Mars News and Mars Weather Data Analysis

For the second part of the challenge, in this line of code "mars_text = [text.text for text in mars_data]" I modified code that I found on StackOverflow that showed how to get text of the whole row in a scraped table.  Previously, I was getting each row data as an individual line and wasn't able to properly format it into a DataFrame.  I also looked up Pandas documentation on how to write a csv file.
